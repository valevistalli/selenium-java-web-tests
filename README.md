# 🧪 Selenium Java E2E Testing Project for saucedemo.com
Hello! This is my end-to-end (E2E) web testing project for saucedemo.com using Selenium WebDriver with Java. I created this project as part of my learning path in test automation and to demonstrate proficiency in test design, automation frameworks, and structured reporting.

This project uses the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to ensure modularity and maintainability. Test execution is managed via TestNG and Maven, and the project is set up to be CI/CD friendly and easily extensible with advanced features like Allure reporting and parallel execution.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language for test implementation.

Selenium WebDriver: Browser automation tool.

TestNG: Test execution framework.

Maven: Build and dependency management.

GitHub Actions (planned): CI pipeline integration.

Description

pages/ – Page Object classes (e.g., LoginPage.java) encapsulating page interactions.

tests/ – Test scenarios written using TestNG (e.g., LoginTest.java).

utils/ – Utility classes such as WebDriver setup (DriverFactory.java).

pom.xml – Maven build configuration and dependency management.

testng.xml – Test suite configuration for TestNG.

README.md – Project overview and instructions.

## 🔐 Page Objects and Modularity
The project implements the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to separate UI logic from test logic, promoting reusability and ease of maintenance.

---

## 🧪 Test Types
1. End-to-End Tests
Stored in the tests/ package, these cover:

- Login success and failure

- Navigation to inventory page

- Adding items to cart (planned)

- Checkout process (planned)

More scenarios coming soon!

## ▶️ Test Execution
Install and Run:

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/selenium-java-web-tests.git
cd selenium-java-web-tests


2. Run test via Maven
   
mvn clean test

---

## ⚙️ Configuration
The testng.xml file controls test suite execution. The pom.xml handles dependencies like Selenium and TestNG, and can be extended for:

- Browser config

- Parallel test execution

- Environment variables
